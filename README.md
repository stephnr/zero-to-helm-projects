## Why { Zero to Helm }?
{ Zero to Helm } is an adventure I undertook to build common infrastructure using the knowledge I have today. With the additive of doing so in a very public format and writing about it via my blog. My main goal is a bit mixed in that I want to do a full "brain-dump" of what I know, but also show junior devs how someone would construct these services after my 10+ years of experience working as a Fullstack Engineer. All in all, its about giving & receiving feedback. I firmly believe that, through this, we all learn to do better in our day to day work as software engineers.

## What kinds of projects will you do?
